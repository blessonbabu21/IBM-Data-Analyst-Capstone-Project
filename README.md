## 📈 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection  
Collected developer survey data from public sources relevant to technology skills and preferences.

### 2. Data Wrangling  
Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing text data, and restructuring columns for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Explored data distributions, outliers, and relationships between variables to uncover patterns.

### 4. Data Visualization  
Created visualizations to highlight:
- Top 10 technologies (languages, databases, platforms, frameworks) currently in use  
- Future technology preferences among developers  
- Demographics: age, education, and country

### 5. Dashboard Development  
Built interactive dashboards using **IBM Cognos Analytics**, with three tabs:
- **Current Technology Usage**
- **Future Technology Trends**
- **Demographics**

### 6. Final Presentation  
Summarized key insights through visuals and dashboards, emphasizing top programming languages, database skills, and development tools.
